Error reporting tool
===================

This application based on Django, allows sending, receiving and viewing errors that occur when building an image.


Setup
-----

Requirements:

* Django 1.4.1. The application was tested with Django 1.4.1 but it may work on a newer version.
* Database server conigured and running. Django will create the database used by the application.
* django-registration (0.8) module;
* django-nvd3 module;

Setup instructions:

1. Create a database and in your Django project configure the settings.py file to access the database.
2. In order to synchronize the database with the Django model, you must run the command: python manage.py syncdb.
   Create an admin account in order to access the admin interface (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).
3. You can start the server by running: python manage.py runserver. Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/Errors/ with your browser.
4. Create an image and if it fails, send the file to the server by running "send-error-report errors_fileName".
5. You can modify the html templates from the templates directory.


Usage
-----

In order to send the error to the server, all you have to do is to run "send-error-report file_name" ("file_name" is the file where the errors are stored).
Then, you will receive a link to view your entry from the graphical interface. Also you can see statistical information based on all the errors from database.
